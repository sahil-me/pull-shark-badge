## 📌 What is the Pull Shark Badge?
The **Pull Shark badge** is awarded when you **open and merge Pull Requests** on GitHub.

- **Symbol**: Symbolized by a shark 🦈 (sharks “pull” strongly through water 🌊).
- **Purpose**: Represents **good collaboration** because PRs are merged after contributing changes.
- **Unlock**: ✅ Earn it by merging your own PRs or having your PRs merged into someone else’s repository.

### 🔻 Requirements:

- **✅ Public repositories only** - PRs to private repos don't count
- **✅ Merged PRs required** - Open PRs without merging won't count
- **✅ Verified email** - Commit email must match your GitHub account email
- **✅ Default branch** - PRs must be merged into main/master branch
- **✅ Original authorship** - You must be the author of the PR

> ⚠️ **Important**: These requirements are critical for badge eligibility

---

### 1️⃣ Solo Method (Your Own Repo)

- **Create a Repository**
    - Name: `github-pull-shark-badge-guide`
    - Public + README

- **Make a Change in a Branch**
    - Create branch: `pull-shark-branch`
    - Edit `README.md` or add `demo.txt`:

```

- **Open a Pull Request (PR)**

### 2️⃣ Contributor Method (Collaboration)

  - **Find open source projects** with labels like `@firstcontributions`
